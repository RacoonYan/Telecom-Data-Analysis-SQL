## Question 4

Wild West wants a switch traffic volume comparisons for international long distance calls. For each switch id, Wild West needs to compare the number of messages and minutes for one month to the same numbers of the following month. To get accurate traffic comparisons, these numbers need to be reported by the CST hour the call was connected. To better do volume planning, they need to also see the percentage change, up of down, in messages and minutes from one month to another for any two given months. Use January and February 1999 data for signoff.
